This is a project I did for my Data Visualization class which uses COVID-19 data from January 2020 to July 2020. It uses the numpy, pandas, and plotly.express libraries in Python to manipulate and graph the data.

View the notebook here (github can't display the plotly graphs): https://nbviewer.org/github/tengento/covid-data-visualization/blob/main/covid-19%20visualization%20project.ipynb
